# LISHS PPE Solution Project
This is a collection of documents generated from a group project that I led for the HHA 502- Health Information Systems course. The assignment was to create a solution for issues regarding management and distribution of PPE during periods of shortages for a sample hospital organization named Long Island Sound Health System (LISHS).
